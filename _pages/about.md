# About me

#### Hi, my name is Richard Scott and I'm an illustrator, cartoonist and designer based in Leicester, UK. I specialise in bright and bold illustrations with subjects from the cute to the bizarre.

My drawing career started the day my older brother taught be how to draw googly eyes on a squared paper pad. I was fascinated about the worlds I could make on the paper, so I kept drawing and I haven't stopped since.

I'm always in on the lookout for new projects whether they are editorial illustrations, wedding invites, illustrated books or one-off personal commissions please feel free to [get in touch](/contact).
