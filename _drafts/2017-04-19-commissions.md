## Forming a rough idea for your project

Before you get in touch with an illustrator it's probably worth getting a few rough ideas together for your commission so you can brief your illustrator well. Here are a few questions you might want to ask yourself to clarify your thoughts.

##### Who is it for?

Is this commission personal or is it for a friend or family member. It's always really useful for your illustrator to know who the finished item is for - it can also help them form your idea if you aren't sure exactly what you're after'.

##### What is the subject?

Is the subject going to the person the commission is for, you or pop culture characters. Knowing the subject matter can also help you pick the right illustrator.

##### How would you like the illustration presented?

An illustration need not be limited to a one off poster or card. Illustrations you commission could be printed on a T-Shirt or made into a book.

##### Where 

##### Why 

##### When

Do you have a specific deadline for the illustration. You will need to make time for:

* Thinking time
* Amendments
* 

## Be realistic about your budget

Be realistic about the costs, the more complex the design, the more expensive the finished product. A comic page with lots of detail can take several hours to draw full colour realistic portrait can't be created in minutes. Different illustrators will work at a different rate depending on their style. Don't expect people to work for free, illustration is skilled work just like any other.

For reference here are some prices for a couple of recent commissions:

* An A4 illustrated birthday card with portrait 3-4 hours at £80
* An 8 Page story book with 7 illustrations varying complexity £400

## Find the right illustrator for your project

Ask yourself what kind of style would work the best. For an example an illustrator who's great at drawing cute fluffy animals isn't necessarily going to be the right artist for a photo-realistic portrait.

Ultimately there is no replacement for looking through an illustrator's portfolio to get a feel for their strengths. You might want to take a look at [mine](/)
