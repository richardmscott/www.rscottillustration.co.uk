For those of you who don't know already Sourdough is bread made using the 'wild yeasts' found in flour instead of commercially made yeasts. Unlike industrially cultured yeasts, wild yeasts aren't haven't been selected for speed, this means that the bread will normally take longer to rise. The benefit though is that this longer process of fermentation that occurs lets the bread develop a more distinctive flavour and there is evidence it also helps break down the gluten in the bread to making easier to digest.

## Introducing the Sourdough Starter

To make your own sourdough bread you will need a 'sourdough starter'. A sourdough starter is simply a mixture of flour and water which makes a nice home for the friendly wild yeasts that are used to make sourdough bread. It's unusual stuff to the unitiated and doesn't look or smell particularly appealing…

## Getting started

To begin your own sourdough starter, all you need is water, bread flour and a clean sealable container.

1. Add one cup of flour and one cup of warm water to your container and stir thoroughly.
2. Seal the container and leave for 24 hours. Keep it somewhere warm but away from radiators.
3. Every day for a week ‘feed’ your starter with 1/4 cup of water and 1/4 cup of flour.
4. Watch each day and observe your starter begin to bubble. Bubbling is the sign that the yeast is digesting the flour - it also means that it’s ready for making bread.

Once your starter is foaming I would also consider naming it, after all, sourdough is a living thing that will need 'feeding' with flour and water every so often. My starter is called Cthulu, my brother's fiancé [Concepta](https://twitter.com/conceptacassar) calls hers Lazarus.

## Simple Sourdough Bread

This is my personal method for making sourdough bread, I cannot claim that it is fanciest or the best but it takes about 15-20 minutes of work per loaf and even better: it requires minimal washing up.

### Equipment

* A dutch oven or cast iron pot that can take high heat
* Baking parchment
* A large mixing bowl
* A spatula

### Ingredients

* 500g bread flour
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 cup of Sourdough Starter (well fed and bubbling away)
* Water (All flours and sourdough starters are different so it's best to do this by eye)

### The first rise
	
1. Add the bread flour, salt and sourdough starter to a large bowl with one cup of water.
2. Mix with the spatula slowly adding water until the dough comes together. The correct consistency with hold together but shouldn't be too wet to handle.  
3. Once the dough starts coming together, begin kneading, folding the dough in on itself. I personally do this in the mixing bowls because it reduces the amount of mess created. Knead for about 10 minutes.
5. Cover the bowl with a wet tea towel, plastic wrap or a plate and leave the dough to rise for 8 hours.
	
Tip: If you start your bread before you go to work when you get home for the evening you should be able to get started on the next stage.

### The second rise
	
6. Take your dutch oven and line it with baking parchment ready to add your dough. The second rise can be completed inside the dutch oven. Use plenty of excess so you can use the parchment to lift the loaf out of the dutch oven.
7. Now it's time to take a look at your dough. It should have risen whilst you've been out and all being well should have almost doubled in size. Next knock down the dough: simply punch the dough to knock out all the air.
8. Place though into your prepared dutch oven or cast iron pot and cover leaving it to rise for 2 hours.
	
### Baking
	
9. Preheat your oven to 250°C.
10. Once up to heat bake the bread with it's lid on for 40 minutes.
11. After forty minutes remove the loaf from the dutch oven and lift the loaf out using the baking parchment and then wrap in a tea towl whilst it cools.
	
You should now have yourself a lovely homemade sourdough loaf!
