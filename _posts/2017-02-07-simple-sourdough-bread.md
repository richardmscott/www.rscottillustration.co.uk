Although sourdough bread is becoming increasingly well-known, not everybody knows what makes it different from other breads. True sourdough bread is made using the 'wild yeasts' found in flour instead of commercially grown yeast. Commercially grown yeasts produce light, fast-rising bread with a neutral flavour. The wild yeasts in sourdough work more slowly but they have the benefit of developing a more complex flavour. This longer process of fermenting the dough also helps break down the gluten in the flour and makes the vitamins and minerals within the bread easier to absorb.

## Introducing the Sourdough Starter

To make your own sourdough bread you will need a 'sourdough starter'. A sourdough starter is simply a mixture of flour and water which creates a home for the friendly wild yeasts that are used to make sourdough bread. To the uninitiated a sourdough starter looks quite sinister, a strange smelling sludge but don’t be fearful it makes excellent bread.

## Making your own Sourdough Starter

To begin your own sourdough starter, all you need is water, bread flour and a clean sealable container.

1. Add one cup of flour and one cup of warm water to your container and stir thoroughly.
2. Seal the container and leave for 24 hours. Keep it somewhere warm but away from radiators.
3. Every day for a week ‘feed’ your starter with 1/4 cup of water and 1/4 cup of flour.
4. Watch each day and observe your starter begin to bubble. Bubbling is the sign that the yeast is digesting the flour - it also means that it’s ready for making bread.

Your sourdough is a living thing, it will need feeding every so often to ensure that the yeasts keep active. After a while you might find it starts to become a bit like a pet I named mine Cthulhu whilst my brother's fiancé, [Concepta](https://twitter.com/conceptacassar), calls hers Lazarus.

## Simple Sourdough Bread

This is my personal method for making sourdough bread, it takes around 15-20 minutes of hands-on work per loaf, which means it’s relatively convenient to make even if you’re busy. I’m sure there are technically superior methods out there but in terms of convenience I think it’s hard to beat.

### Equipment

* A dutch oven or cast iron pot
* Baking parchment
* A large mixing bowl
* A spatula

### Ingredients

* 500g bread flour
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 cup of Sourdough Starter (well fed and bubbling away)
* Water (All flours and sourdough starters are different so it's best to do this by eye)

### The first rise
	
1. Add the bread flour, salt and sourdough starter to a large bowl with one cup of water.
2. Mix with the spatula slowly adding water until the dough comes together. The correct consistency will hold together but shouldn't be too wet to handle.  
3. Once the dough starts coming together, begin kneading, folding the dough in on itself (I do this in the mixing bowl). Knead for about 10 minutes.
5. Cover the bowl with a wet tea towel, plastic wrap or a plate and leave the dough to rise about 8 hours.

### The second rise
	
6. Take your dutch oven and line it with baking parchment ready to add your dough. The second rise can be completed inside the dutch oven.
7. Now it's time to take a look at your dough. It should have risen whilst you've been out and all being well should have almost doubled in size. Next knock down the dough: simply punch the dough to knock out all the air.
8. Place though into the lined dutch oven or cast iron pot and cover leaving it to rise for 2 hours.
	
### Baking
	
9. Preheat your oven to 250°C.
10. Once up to heat bake the bread with it's lid on for 40 minutes.
11. After forty minutes remove the loaf from the oven and lift the loaf out. Wrap the loaf in a tea towel whilst it cools.
	
You should now have yourself a lovely homemade sourdough loaf!
