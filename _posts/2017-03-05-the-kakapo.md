The Kakapo is a endangered species of parrot found only in New Zealand. In June 2016 there were only 154 left in the world. Unusually for a parrot they are flightless and nocturnal.

They were once the most common birds in New Zealand but European settlers clearing vast tracts of land destroyed much of their habitat bringing their species perilously close to the brink of extinction.

They evolved with very few predators so when humans arrived in New Zealand they were incredibly easy to hunt. The Kakapo's main means of defence against predators is simply to 'freeze' and hope that the predator can't see them. Reputedly when European explorers arrived in New Zealand in the 1800s they used to catch them just by shaking trees!

## The Kakapo doesn’t seem to know it can’t fly

Despite being the world’s only flightless parrot most of the Kakapo’s favourite foods are high up in the trees. They use their sharp claws and beak to help them climb. Their wings are only really useful to help them break their fall on the way down.

## Heavyweight Champion

The Kakapo is world's heaviest parrot a fact which probably doesn't help their flying abilities. A male Kakapo can weigh up to 4kg - that's double the weight of some species of Macaw. Despite their portly stature Kakapo's are also the world's longest lived bird can live up to 95 years!
